  <h1>All about me<h1>
  <h3>Hi! My name is Kevin Sonukan, and I am international trade working professional. My passion for international trade comes from my passion for international affairs since I was a child. I have used my passions and knowledge to conduct research and analysis in a work setting, have travelled the world, and continue to push my horizons in world changing thoughts. I like learning to code because I can contribute to a better, more efficient future for humanity. My hobbies, among others, include powerlifting, cooking, and travelling.<h3>
